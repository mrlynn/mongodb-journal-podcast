## Show Notes

Introduction of the The Journal Podcast

My name is Michael Lynn and I lead Developer Relations at MongoDB. Each week, I'll be bringing you a short update that will include some (hopefully) interesting information about the world of Software Engineering, Development and Databases.

This podcast will be an eclectic mix of all things data and all things developer. I'll definitely look to bring you detailed information about MongoDB and the products and services we offer here but it won't be restricted to MongoDB.

Do you have a question - or would you like to see a topic covered on the podcast, head on over to Bit.ly/journalquestions
